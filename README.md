# Eliza question bot

I participated in teacher training on the weekend.  One of the activities  was a game where you answer 5 why questions in a row.  the questions started with something simple: why do you like chocolate, I say because I like things that are a bit bitter, why do you like things that are bitter, because I am so sweet, why are you so sweet, because I want people to like me, why do you want people to like me, because I am afraid of being alone.
